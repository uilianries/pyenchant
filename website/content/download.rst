Downloading PyEnchant
---------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get PyEnchant up and running, you will need the following software
installed:

* Python 3.5 or later
* The `enchant <http://www.abisource.com/enchant/>`_ library, version
  1.5.0 or later.

Using pypi wheels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended way to install pyenchant is to usse `pip
<https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in a recent version, which in turn
will download pre-compiled wheel if one is found that is compatible with the
current Python version and platform.

You can see the list of available wheels `on pypi.org <https://pypy.org>`_.
